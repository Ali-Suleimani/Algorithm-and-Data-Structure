# Algorithm-and-Data-Structure
This course algorithm and data structure is about implement and evaluating different types of algorithm and includes most of my projects
# Course content
## Basic algorithm analysis:
- Simpler analysis with respect to the resource needs of algorithms in the form of time and memory.
## Fundamental algorithm
- simple numerical algorithms
- sequential and binary search algorithms
- Depth first search and Width first search.
- sorting algorithms: selection sorting, insertion sorting, Quicksort, heapsort, mergesort.
## Fundamental data structures:
- linear lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary tree, heaps, binary search trees and problem trees.
## Program Design:
- design and implementation of programmes that use basic algorithms and data structures to solve computer science problems.
## Intended learning outcomes
- describe a number of common algorithms for search and sorting and their properties
- compare algorithms with regard to time and memory usage
- implement data structures as linear lists stacks, queues, hash tables, binary tree and search trees
- identify problems where the data structures above are useful and design simple algorithms with these
- write programmes that use algorithms and data structures by means of good programming principles such as systematic tests and abstraction
- model problems as search problems and implement algorithms for breadth-first-search, depth-first-search or best-first-search
